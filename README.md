# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This project was created to show the user the weather outlook for multiple cities so that they can plan a trip accordingly. This is done by fulfilling the following requirements:
* When the start button is clicked, the timer starts and the first question is shown.
* When the user searches for a city, they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and it is added to the search history.
* When the user views the current weather conditions for a city, they are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of the weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.
* When the user views the UV index, they are presented with a color that tells them if the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
* When the user views future weather conditions for a city, they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
* When the user clicks on a city in the search history, they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city (NOT MET).
